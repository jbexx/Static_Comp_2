This project is our second Static Comp project.  It is a fully responsive design using flexbox and setting media queries for break points at certain screen widths to continue a flow of an aesthetic layout. I started with a mobile first approach, designing the initial page for a mobile device of a screen width of 320px. From there I scaled up and as the layout became stretched and not aesthetically pleasing, I put a break point in with a media query and adjusted the layout to come back into a proper, usable design layout.  The 'cards' on the page are set to a hard width and height so when the page is stretched or shrunk, the cards will wrap to the next line.  The cards are centered on the page, in order to keep the cards that scroll to the bottom from centering themselves on that bottom line I created empty `div`s as place holders to push the visible cards into the proper alignment.
